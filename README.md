# Activity Reporter
This is a rival app to a popular photo-sharing website. As a part of that app, I build the following simple features:
1. Setup a social graph, so that one user may follow another user. (No approval from other users required). 
2. Enter user actions, user can upload and like other users' photos. 
3. Activity reporting, so that a user knows about the activities performed by themselves and the following users.
4. Trending, show top 3 most liked photos.

### How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository
2. Open your terminal and make sure the directory already inside the project 
3. Run `go run .` in terminal to start the Program on CLI (Command Line Interface)
